# Overview 

In our college school lives it’s difficult to buy or make our own meals especially for the ones who have limited or low on budget. Keeping our health and nutrition in check especially how hectic and stressful college can be, often times we neglect our eating habits. So, we came up with a website that will show you possible cooking recipes that’ll satisfy you and your budget as well as better your eating habits. 

# Problem Solution: 

Offer budget and well-balanced recipes for college students for the betterment of their eating habits and budget.  

# Target Users: 
- Our target users will be college students who are interested in cooking up their own meals, recipes that will also be budget friendly and better their eating habits. 
- For novice cooks, who look for recipes that are simple to follow and only require rudimentary culinary knowledge. 
- Students who are pressed for time and must balance extracurricular activities and coursework tend to choose easy-to-make meals that can be prepared quickly and easily.
- UniGrub will be a website for college students to show them alternative ways to cook up their meals that'll fit their range of budget.
